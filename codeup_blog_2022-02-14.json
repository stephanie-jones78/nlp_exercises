If you\u2019re new to tech, you might be wondering: Do certifications really matter? Welcome to IT Certifications 101! What\u2019s the tl;dr? Certifications are critical to getting past HR for certain roles, but they won\u2019t get you the job.\nWhat are IT Certifications?\nCertifications are official credentials given by companies, institutions, and vendors to verify that you have demonstrated a specific knowledge or skill. They are a stamp of approval from a known brand (like Amazon) saying \u201cThis person knows their stuff.\u201d Certs are used in a lot of industries, including technology. Even within tech, there are dozens of vendors and hundreds of certs.\nWhy do IT Certifications matter to employers?\nMany roles (including security, system administration, and networking) require certain certs to make it in the door of an interview process. This filter matters for several reasons: it helps narrow down the pool of applicants, it establishes a baseline of shared knowledge or experience across all applicants, and it expedites the process so that employers don\u2019t have to spend as much time vetting basic technical skills.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do they matter to you?\nObtaining certs in IT will provide you with a number of benefits:\n\nYou will show up in recruiter searches on LinkedIn!\nYou can follow specific, concrete paths for your career development\nYou obtain industry-recognized, respected, and transferable credentials relevant for your whole career\nYou develop relevant and broad-base content knowledge\nYou will be able to pass initial HR screenings and land a seat in the interview\n\nWhy DON\u2019T they matter to employers and you?\nAt the end of the day, certifications are just pieces of paper. They represent your ability to pass a test, not to do a job. Sometimes those things are one and the same, but usually, they are very different. Certifications are like the entrance fee to get into a tournament: you still need to fight your way to the top. And when you\u2019re standing in the ring, it\u2019s better to know how to fight than to have a degree in fighting.\nAdditionally, not all jobs within tech care about certifications at all. For example, there is technically a Java programming certification from Oracle, but it\u2019s almost never required or considered for job applications because it tests very specific, abnormal, and academic concepts that don\u2019t apply to most real-world software development.\nIf Certs matter AND don\u2019t matter, what do I do?\nAt Codeup, we like to think of our IT training as CertificationsPLUS, as in \u2013 you get certifications PLUS hands-on experience. Here\u2019s a quick way to think about it: Amazon Web Services has basic certifications called Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Associate. The official Amazon training for these certs is 1 week: 4 days of training and 1 day of exam readiness. The 1-week schedule will present to you mostly everything you need to pass the certification exam, and then it\u2019s on you to go cram and memorize to get ready. Once you pass, you\u2019ll have the cert, but you\u2019ll be a paper tiger: all bark and no bite. In other words, you\u2019ll appear knowledgeable and skillful on paper, but in reality, you won\u2019t have any experience or know-how for completing the real work.\nAlternatively, Codeup spends 5 weeks on AWS, combining exam study and hands-on practice. That way, you can talk the talk and walk the walk.\nIf you want to learn more about IT certification and training paths, reach out to us at info@codeup.com!","3":"In the last few months, the US has experienced dozens of major cyberattacks against leading organizations like Accenture, the NBA, and Kia Motors. Similar attacks are on the rise. This year, 38% more companies have experienced cyber attacks as compared to last year. Often, they involve a ransom payment in order to re-access stolen files. The amount paid by these victims has increased by 300%. In our headquarters of San Antonio, Texas, even local organizations are at risk. Recently, Judson ISD paid a $500,000 ransom.\nIn 2020, there were over 300,000 open roles for cybersecurity professionals in the US. To add to that, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a 31% increase in Information Security roles in the upcoming years. As attacks are on the rise, the demand for cybersecurity professionals is quickly increasing. But with so many open roles, the issue isn\u2019t demand \u2013 it\u2019s supply.\nLuckily, San Antonio is already a national leader in cybersecurity. We have over 16,000 employees in the field, which is the most certified cyber professionals outside of D.C.. With industry giants like USAA and Lockheed Martin in the city, we have a good footing over much of the country. Moreover, San Antonio is Military City, USA. We\u2019re home to one of the largest populations of bases, veterans, and active service members in the country. With both these backgrounds, the city is well-positioned to continue to lead our country\u2019s defense \u2013 not just traditionally, but in cyber warfare as well. \nBut we still need more help. What can we do about it? Train more cybersecurity professionals. Organizations like Project Quest have supported cybersecurity training for years. But we can\u2019t rely solely on non-profit funding. There are plenty of opportunities for veterans to enter the field with VA benefits. Training programs like Codeup Cloud Academy are approved to accept GI Bill\u00ae and Vocational Rehab. This allows veterans to receive housing support while getting the cybersecurity training they need in our Cyber Cloud program.\nWant to keep San Antonio safe and positioned as a leader in Cybersecurity? Help us train the next generation of cybersecurity professionals! Connect us with veterans in your network so we can all help continue San Antonio\u2019s tradition of protecting our city and country!","4":"As the end of military service gets closer, many transitioning service members often ask, \u201cCan the GI Bill\u00ae pay for a coding bootcamp?\u201d The answer is yes, but only if the coding bootcamp is on the VA-approved list.\nThe GI Bill\u00ae will pay for college or a VA-approved coding bootcamp. For bootcamp programs, the VA uses a formula to calculate how much time to deduct from your benefits based on the program\u2019s tuition and how it compares to average college costs.\nThat\u2019s good news for veterans looking for a second career in the technology sector. The tech industry is fast-paced, action-oriented, and often focused on completing small goals to accomplish large ones, a familiar process for those trained by the military. With average salaries for entry-level programmers averaging around $80,000, it\u2019s a great time to learn how to code and get paid for your expertise.\nWhy attend a coding bootcamp instead of college?\nYou could always attend a two- or four-year college degree program in computer science and learn software development. Or you could train for these jobs by completing a specialized bootcamp program.\nCoding bootcamps teach widely used programming languages and frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Python on Django, JavaScript, and PHP stacks through project-based learning. Students graduate from bootcamps with a portfolio, an online presence, interview skills, and more. Most courses even help graduates find an internship or match students with an employer network.\nA bootcamp is an immersive, intense full-time learning environment. Students should prepare to scale back outside activities and give up full-time employment for the program\u2019s course. Coding bootcamps vary in length from six to 28 weeks, although the average time is about 14 weeks long. Military service members transitioning from active duty to veteran status can often leverage terminal leave to attend a coding bootcamp.\nIf you\u2019re still wondering whether to choose a college program or a tech career accelerator, here are some points to consider:\n\nCollege isn\u2019t for everyone. You may not have the time or money for four years of study or aren\u2019t interested in all the extras that come with college life.\nGI Bill\u00ae education benefits can pay for tuition, housing, and other associated costs of attending an approved bootcamp, much like when you attend college.\nInterviewers for coding and developer jobs evaluate you on practical skills and experience, not your academic performance. Many bootcamps feature a Capstone project, in-depth work to solve a problem that becomes part of your portfolio so you can show potential employers what you can do.\nMany bootcamps have job placement programs to help you find an internship or land a job after graduation.\nIn some cases, bootcamp programs will offer a job guarantee within a certain amount of time after graduation, or they will refund your tuition costs.\n\nWhat should veterans look for in a Bootcamp?\nA tech workforce development program usually translates into extensive, hands-on instruction in say, learning how to write code in less time than it takes to complete a two- or four-year degree program. Some bootcamps may be offered through established state or private universities, while some private providers offer training programs.\nWhat should you look for in a bootcamp?\n\nThe bootcamp should meet the criteria as a VA-approved institution. Some coding schools may have only some programs that are GI Bill\u00ae eligible, but not others.\nBootcamps typically can adapt to changes in the tech industry faster than a college. Ask if the curriculum incorporates feedback from industry partners and is updated to teach the latest practices.\nCoding bootcamps should be training students in practical skills. Will you get to work with a client or organization on a project? See if the program you\u2019re interested in offers a Capstone project or an internship as part of the curriculum.\nA successful bootcamp ensures its students get the jobs they are trained to do, so check on job placement resources and guarantees. Resume help, interview training, and a robust network of industry partners interested in hiring graduates means better chances of getting that sought-after tech job.\nA school offering a tuition refund guarantee is aligning its business incentives with the interests of its students. If students aren\u2019t successful, then neither is the school. Look for a tuition policy that either defers tuition payment until employed in a qualified position or guarantees a refund should a student fail to land a tech job within a specific timeframe.\n\nIf you\u2019re a veteran in Texas, Codeup offers GI Bill\u00ae eligible programs\nTexas-based Codeup offers accelerated programs in San Antonio, Austin, Dallas, and Houston to help you launch your tech career. No previous experience is needed to participate in any of Codeup\u2019s accelerator programs, all of which are GI Bill\u00ae eligible.\nApply to Codeup\u2019s full-stack web development to learn how to create an app or website from start to finish using today\u2019s coding languages in just 20 weeks.Apply to Codeup\u2019s systems engineering bootcamp if you\u2019re up for problem-solving in information technology in this 13-week accelerator.Apply to Codeup\u2019s data science bootcamp if you\u2019d like to be a data scientist and learn how to apply machine learning models to make predictions and turn your insights into actionable recommendations over the course of 20 weeks.\nYou\u2019ll also get professional job application counseling and support as an ongoing part of our curriculum, which continues even after graduation. Veterans and their dependents may also apply for a Codeup scholarship to offset the amount of VA benefits used for tuition.\nCodeup\u2019s job guarantee means you\u2019ll get hired for a tech job you\u2019ve trained for within six months of graduating or receive a refund of 100% of your tuition.\nFor more information on Codeup\u2019s GI Bill\u00ae eligible bootcamp programs, reach out to one of our admissions specialists for more details or call us at 210-802-7289.\nContributing Author Iris Gonzalez.","5":"What IT Career should I choose?\nIf you\u2019re thinking about a career in IT, there are a lot of directions you could go. You could become a web developer or data scientist or study UI\/UX and graphic design. Or for those of you reading right now, you might be looking at entering a career in networking, cybersecurity, or cloud administration. Which might lead you to ask: what\u2019s the difference, and which program is right for me?\nBoth these programs are 13-weeks long. While they have different names, they share a lot of similar content as entry-level IT accelerators. Of the seven technical modules, four of them are shared. Both cover:\n\nNetworking \u2013 Gain in-depth exposure to networks and topics across the OSI model,\u00a0 networks, protocols, and packet Capture, network analysis, and more.\nLinux \u2013 Gain exposure and get hands-on configuring and maintaining the Linux operating system.\nWindows \u2013 Exposure to the Windows Server 2012 R2 Operating System to learn server management functions using Server Manager and basic command-line utilities and tools to run from the command prompt.\nAWS \u2013 Become familiar with key industry terms and concepts while building a foundation of cloud product knowledge across Amazon Web Services.\n\nNetworking, Linux, Windows, and AWS are a LOT of content for new IT employees. Outside of this content, the programs split into their areas of focus:\n\nCyber Cloud gets students certified in Security+ and AWS\nSystems Engineering gets students certified in Network+ and Linux+\n\nNow that you understand where the programs are similar and where they differ, which one is right for you? Here are some questions to consider:\n\nDo I have any technical work experience?\nDo I have any training or education in IT?\nDo you prefer solving open-ended and ambiguous problems, or concrete problems with solutions?\nAre you interested in building and developing systems, or in securing and protecting systems?\n\nIf you don\u2019t have any work or education in IT, the Systems Engineering program is the one for you. It is designed to be the 0-1 step in your IT career to get you started! If you do have work experience or education in IT, then you might be interested in Cyber Cloud. Why is that?\nOur programs focus on CompTIA certifications, which is a major industry provider in technical training. The typical track through their IT certifications is to start with their A+, then complete their Network +, and then progress to their Security +. That means if you don\u2019t have your Network + (or relevant experience), it can be really hard to catch up.\nStill not sure which is right for you?

But if you\u2019re new to tech, you might be wondering\u2026what is Systems Engineering?\nWhat is Systems Engineering?\nIn IT terms, a Systems Engineer (Sysadmin or Sysad for short) is responsible for the configuration, upkeep, and operation of computer systems. They manage things like security, storage, automation, troubleshooting, and a whole lot more. For example, some of the day to day tasks include things like:\n\nReviewing system logs for anomalies and issues\nUpdating operating systems (OS)\nInstalling new hardware and software\nManaging user accounts\nDocumenting information about the system setup\nManaging file systems\n\nYou might be thinking, \u201cWoah, that looks like a lot!\u201d and that\u2019s because it is! A Systems Engineer is a critical piece of IT infrastructure. And in today\u2019s digital age, all companies are IT companies, which means Sysadmins are critical everywhere. You can think of a Sysad as a jack-of-all-trades of what we typically think of as IT. But don\u2019t forget how the old saying actually ends: \u201cA jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of none.\u201d So, what are the skills a Sysadmin uses?\n\nNetworking \u2013 Networking skills include how to configure, maintain, and troubleshoot networks, including using hardware like switches, routers, and firewalls. These skills and concepts are crucial to any systems engineering position. You not only need to understand them but also need some way to prove it. With the Network+ certification, job seekers can come to employers with proof of their networking know-how.\nLinux- Linux is one of the most popular Operating Systems (OS). It is fully compatible with Mac OS and underpins all Android systems. In fact, the world\u2019s IT infrastructure is run primarily on Linux. Certifications are the primary way technical folks prove their skills and Linux is no different. The CompTIA Linux+ certification is an entry-level certification that proves knowledge and basic technical proficiency in the job role\nCloud \u2013 This involves using servers and tools (i.e. processing and storage hardware) that are based in a different location, instead of on-site. Our program introduces students to cloud concepts like storage, computing, permissions, and more!\n\nWhy Become a Systems Engineer?\nNow you know what a Sysadmin does and what skills they use. But why become a Sysadmin? The world is increasingly dependent on computer systems and their underlying technologies. Configuring computer software, designing innovative solutions for specific problems, and basic troubleshooting skills are more and more in demand each year.\u00a0 Without systems engineers, the technical world would stop innovating and become stagnant.\n\nThey are in demand! Companies rely on Sysadmins to keep all their IT running\nYou\u2019ll become a tech guru! You won\u2019t just be the person who can fix the printer. You\u2019ll also be the person who can script, work with servers, navigate AWS Cloud tools, and work on modern web technologies.\nYou can specialize! With the breadth of knowledge you\u2019ll obtain, you can have a specialized career in IT. Just hone in on one of your interests, whether it\u2019s security, cloud, databases, or something that doesn\u2019t even exist yet!\n\nInterested in learning more?

Apply to our 13-week Systems Engineering program where you\u2019ll earn your Network+ and Linux+ certifications, along with skills in AWS, LAMP, Microsoft, and more!","7":"By: Alicia Gonzalez\nBefore Codeup, I was a home health Speech-Language Pathologist Assistant. I would go from home to home working with children anywhere from 1 year old to 18 years old. After 5 years of the profession, my body was getting tired driving around all the time and I felt overworked. The work was satisfying and I do miss working with the kiddos, but I just felt drained. I knew it was time to find a different field, so I started thinking about what else I was good at.\nThen one day as I was on my way to a patient\u2019s home, I found a Codeup billboard near Splashtown that said \u201cdrive to a job you love\u201d and I took it as a sign. I thought, \u201cI want to drive to a job I love!\u201d I had also heard nothing but good things about Codeup from a friend that went the Web Development route. She answered my questions and helped me through the whole process.\nAt first, I was a little worried about tuition payment, but once I got started in the application process, they held Zoom meetings where they would talk about all the funding options. They made it really easy and addressed all of my concerns. I realized I didn\u2019t have to be scared about the financial aspect. I applied to a couple of grants and was able to get about a third of my tuition covered through the Train for Jobs SA grant from Workforce Solutions Alamo. That really helped me. I also received a few different scholarships from Codeup. The rest of it was a loan from Meritize.\nIt was difficult leaving something I was comfortable and familiar with to start something new with no data science background, but I have always enjoyed all things tech. Once we got into the pre-assessment work and then the prework leading up to class, it showed me, \u201cokay this IS what I wanted to be doing.\u201d I really enjoyed it, thought it was fun, and realized this was for me.\nOverall, I really enjoyed the program. We were in Zoom the whole time because of the pandemic, but they made it slow, nice, and easy. The instructors are absolutely wonderful. Every single instructor helped me at one point or another, teaching things from ground zero and explaining everything really nicely in a way I can understand. One thing I value the most about the instructors is that, not only do they go over all the necessary skills needed in a data-related career, but they teach us how to learn the skills as well. They didn\u2019t just give us the work and tell us exactly how to do it. They provide instruction, hands-on exercises\/projects, and answers to all questions, but most importantly, they walk us through how to work with the data and obtain the answers on our own. This is extremely valuable as I believe it is the key to success in this field.\nNow after graduating from Codeup, I\u2019m a Business Intelligence Analyst at Liquid Web. I\u2019ve been here almost three months now and I\u2019m contributing to so many projects. I really feel like a true member of the team. I can figure things out for myself and my bosses are telling me how well I\u2019m doing and how far I\u2019ve come since working here. I didn\u2019t have to ask for much help or training, because Codeup prepared me well and taught me how to learn when I run into skills they don\u2019t teach. It\u2019s been really good.\nI\u2019m so glad I made this change. It was scary to take that leap of faith, but ultimately, I\u2019m really glad I did. I love my job and I love what I\u2019m doing. If anyone is looking to make a career change and struggling to find their best fit, I recommend looking into Codeup and going through their process. I\u2019m extremely happy where I am right now and wouldn\u2019t change a thing.","8":"","9":"Looking for the best data science bootcamp in the world?

System administrators are a key component of their organizations. They keep the technology working smoothly and interact with people all across the company. Are you interested in understanding how computers operate? Or are you curious about tech but unsure of what specific tech career you might want? If so, read on to learn why you should become a system administrator!\n\n\n\n\nBe a Tech Wiz\n\n\nA system administrator has a solid foundation of the building blocks of technology. Usually, full-time employees are responsible for the upkeep, configuration, and troubleshooting of computer systems. They know the ins and outs of networking, operating systems, web servers, and databases. This is a great career path if:\n\n\n\n\n\n You want to thoroughly understand how computers operate throughout a long-term career\nYou are interested in tech, but want exposure to various subjects before fully pursuing one thing\n\n\nRequest More Information\n\nAs an almost catch-all position for all things tech, you\u2019ll get exposure to the business and analytics side of tech, computer science, technology management, infrastructure, hardware, and software. All of this variety will help you choose a specialization within system administration or even an entirely different tech career.\n\n\n\n\nGet Started with No Experience\n\n\nTo learn the skills required for the job, you often need to get certifications including CompTIA Network+ and Comp TIA Linux+. Thankfully, you can train for these certifications at programs like Codeup Cloud Academy with no prior experience needed. These sorts of programs provide critical hands-on practice so that you\u2019re job-ready once you have the certifications in hand. Alumni often start out in Help Desk and Tech Support roles and quickly move up to become the System Administrator.\n\n\n\n\nA Skillset More and More Companies Rely On\n\n\nCompanies depend heavily on their computer networks and need them to be fast, reliable, and updated. As more and more companies depend on and invest in technology, more and more will rely on system administrators for this upkeep. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the employment of systems administrators to grow 4 percent from 2019 to 2029. It states:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDemand for information technology (IT) workers is high and should continue to grow as firms invest in newer, faster technology and mobile networks.\u201d\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\n\nOur home base of Texas is actually the state that employs the most system administrators, with 34,410 currently employed.\n\n\n\n\nStart a Salaried Career\n\n\nReady to transition from a personally or physically taxing job to a full-time office job with benefits? Rather than working odd hours, finding people to take your shift, or working for commission, this career path will provide a solid and reliable salary with traditional office hours that allow for a great work\/life balance.\n\n\n\nAccording to salary.com, the average salary of System Administrators in the United States is $67,448. This is the average across all levels of seniority, but of course, salaries range based on experience and location. These are the average salary ranges of System Administrators citywide, statewide, and nationally:\n\n\n\n\n\nSan Antonio (our headquarters): $58,094 to $74,660\nTexas: $58,665 to $75,394\nUnited States: $59,743 to $76,779\n\nYou\u2019re a People Person and Problem-Solver\n\n\nIn this career, you\u2019ll interact with people at all levels of the organization and will need to simply explain complex topics. Good communication skills are a must! You should enjoy working with others and have great customer service skills. In addition, you\u2019ll need to problem solve, think critically, and think quickly. When a network is down on a high-stakes day, it\u2019s your time to shine, but you\u2019ll need to withstand the pressure and act fast.\n\n\n\nReady to earn a reliable salary, use your people skills, and get a skillset that many companies rely on? It only takes a few months to start your new IT career. Get the certification training and hands-on experience you need to launch your career in system administration. Start here.","12":"Did you know that even though we\u2019re an independent school, we have multiple regulating bodies that verify our processes and results? For starters, we\u2019re licensed and regulated by the Texas Workforce Commission. We\u2019re also approved by the SAA Texas Veterans Commission to accept VA Benefits, and audited by the Council for Integrity in Results Reporting. This already gives us a premier status and a trusted brand name. But there\u2019s one missing piece that would take us to the next level: an accrediting body. Now, we\u2019re well on our way there! We are proud to announce that, effective May 2021,  Codeup is a Candidate for Accreditation by The Middle States Association Commission on Secondary Schools (MSA-CSS), which is located at 3624 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104 (Phone: 267-284-5000).\nWhat does this mean?\nAccrediting bodies provide guidance and best practices for institutions like Codeup, and verify the quality of our education. The MSA-CSS in particular is recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education. Getting accredited by them would allow us to establish eligibility to participate in federal Title IV student loan programs for adult students. This could be huge for our applicants, as it would significantly expand access to financial aid and allow even more people to change their lives by launching a tech career at Codeup. We would also be the first and only\u00a0career accelerator with MSA-CSS\u00a0accreditation in Texas. One article even states that coding bootcamps, in general, are not accredited.\nWhen will this happen?\nCurrently, we are a candidate for accreditation, and not yet accredited. (Establishing candidacy is in itself a big feat, and a little bird told us our application was in the top 1% over at least the last 15 years!) Now that we\u2019re candidates, we are actively working with the MSA-CSS to meet or exceed the requirements for accreditation. This process usually takes 18-24 months. Once approved, it would be an additional 12-18 months for Title IV acceptance, which is what would enable students to receive federal loans.\nAs the Premier Career Accelerator in Texas, we are thrilled about this news. Adding this layer of compliance and quality assurance will significantly improve the quality of education we provide and the way that we provide it. It will help us abide by our core values of Delivering Excellence, Acting with Integrity, Cultivating Inclusive Growth, and Being Helpful. It will help us live out our mission of empowering life change on a bigger and better scale, so that we can continue to be the #1 option for Texans looking to launch a career in tech!\nNot familiar with Codeup?

We\u2019ve gone from a humble beginning in the middle of a coworking space called Geekdom, to now having three floors of our own in our favorite downtown building.\nWhy San Antonio?\nCodeup has a campus in Dallas, classrooms in the Rackspace Castle in San Antonio, and offices in Houston and Austin. But Downtown San Antonio is where we were born and raised, and where we\u2019ve planted our flag for our headquarters. While other Texas cities are becoming known for tech, San Antonio never has been. This is the city where we can make the biggest impact on the local tech scene. We\u2019re supplying companies with the in-demand tech talent that has been missing locally while changing lives by launching San Antonians into these tech careers.\u00a0\nWhy the Vogue Building?\nThe SA Tech District is growing downtown and the historic Vogue building is in the heart of it all! We\u2019ve been part of that action for 7 years and in the Vogue Building for 6 of them. Changing careers is a lot of work, both on our staff and students. We want to have fun while doing it! We need an upbeat atmosphere where we can stay plugged into San Antonio and engaged in the tech scene. Steps away from the Majestic Theater, the Riverwalk, and our old home at Geekdom, our students and staff have a location to be excited about. \nWhy the Expansion?\nDuring the pandemic, our staff doubled in size and we\u2019ve outgrown our two floors. As we invite our staff back to working in-office, they need to be able to fit. By expanding into the second floor, our staff will have breathing room and ample space for social distancing. Our classrooms will stay on the 6th floor, where students get the best views of downtown. \nIf you want to get plugged into the San Antonio tech scene, you\u2019ve got options with Codeup! Launch a career in tech as a web developer, data scientist, system administrator, or cyber cloud specialist. Work in the office with us by joining our staff. Or, hire our grads. Hope to see you at the Vogue someday!","14":"Happy Pride Month! Pride Month is a dedicated time to celebrate and support the LGBTQIA+ community. At Codeup, one of our core values is Cultivating Inclusive Growth, something that takes on many shapes, sizes, forms, and colors. From representation in tech to empowering and supporting all, let\u2019s reflect on how we live out this core value for our LGBTQIA+ community, not just during Pride Month, but always.\nCultivating Inclusive Growth\nWe\u2019re firm believers that the people making tech should look like the people using it, which is everyone. We\u2019re proud to offer Pride Scholarships year round, which aim to increase, support, and promote representation of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech. However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered.\nIn a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively. Why the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren\u2019t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth.\nCodeup Initiatives\nTo cultivate inclusive growth, we don\u2019t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students. Equipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town. You can get yours on our merch store! The proceeds support our Pride Scholarship.\nNot only do we want the people making tech to look like the people using it, we also want them to feel safe and empowered to do so. If you\u2019re looking for a career in tech, let us empower you every step of the way! First, apply now. Then, apply for our Pride Scholarship."}}
