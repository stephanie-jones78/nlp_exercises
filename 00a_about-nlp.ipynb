    ">Making sense of large amounts of text data using programming and machine learning\n",
    "## Review\n",
    "5 big questions ML methods can answer:\n",
    "1. Regression | How many or how much of something \n",
    "2. Classification | Is this A or B or C (or something else) \n",
    "3. Clustering | What relationships/groupings/similarities exist in the data already \n",
    "4. Time Series | What should we expect to happen next \n",
    "5. Anamoly Detection | Is this weird?\n",

    "## Use Cases\n",

    "## Methods\n",
    "- Text classification\n",
    "    - Supervised (working with labeled data)\n",
    "    - Classification models, assigning tags or categories to text and its content\n",
    "- Topic modeling\n",

    "## Process\n",
    "1. Acquiring text documents\n",
    "    - **`Corpus`**: a body of text\n",
    "        - Tv show transcripts\n",
    "        - Emails/texts\n",

    "    - Normalizing text\n",
    "        - Lowercase\n",
    "        - Removing special characters\n",
    "        - Stem or lemmatize words (standardizing, *i.e. run, running, runs == run*\n",
    "        - n-grams: co-occuring words that have meaning when used together *i.e. data science, a lot, etc.*\n",
    "        - Parts of speech (POS) tagging\n",
    "        - Chunking\n",
    "        - Vectorization\n",

    "\n",
    "## Vocab\n",
    "- **`stemming`** reducing words to their stem root (chop)\n",
    "- **`lemmatization`** boiling words down to thier simple dictionary meaning (context, *i.e. better become good*)\n",
    "- **`tokenization`** breaking up text into linguistic units\n",
    "- **`entity`** the type of entity extracted (person, place, or thing)\n",
    "- **`corpus`** set of documents\n",
    "- **`document`** a single observation (like the body of an email)\n",
    "- **`sentence`** (sometime may want to treat a single sentence as a `document`"
