    "\n",
    "Words which have little or no significance, especially when constructing meaningful features from text, are known as stop words (or stopwords). These are usually words that end up having the maximum frequency if you do a simple term or word frequency in a corpus. Typically, these can be articles, conjunctions, prepositions and so on. Some examples of stopwords: a, an, the, and like.\n",
